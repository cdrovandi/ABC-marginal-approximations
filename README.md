# ABC-marginal-approximations
 Code to support the paper "Improving the Accuracy of Marginal Approximations in Likelihood-Free Inference via Localisation" available at https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.06655.
 
Each folder contains the code for a different example of the paper.

Note that the lattice-free example uses mex files to speed up the code.  These have been compiled in a Windows OS so it may not run on other operating systems, and the cpp code may need to be compiled again.

For the robust regression example, some data and code related to the below paper has been taken from https://github.com/jrlewi/brlm_paper/.

John R. Lewis, Steven N. MacEachern, Yoonkyung Lee (2021).  Bayesian Restricted Likelihood Methods: Conditioning on Insufficient Statistics in Bayesian Regression (with Discussion).  Bayesian Anal. 16(4): 1393-1462.

Some of the files to support the visualisation of results have been obtained from freely available sources:
